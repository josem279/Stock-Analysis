# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to create a more efficient workbook capable of calculating the total volume and price change of all stocks within the stock market over a one year period.

## Results

By refactoring the Stock Analysis macro, the time that it takes for the workbook to analyze the 12 stocks in question was expedited. 

## Summary

**1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**

Some of the potential advantages of refactoring code inlcude adjusting code to more specifically meet the needs of certain analysis, improving the code readability (by making it more simple or including comments that detail the code), and by making it more efficient and dynamic.

**2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**

When looking at this particular VBA script as an example, I believe that we were able to implement almost all of the pros that come with refactoring code. The code was easy to read by adding comments that detailed every individual aspect of the subroutine. The flow of the code was nicer
